# Monkey-Swing-Game
My First PyGame Porject 

It's an interactive python game where the user is able to collect coins, use them in a shop, track their own level. This is a game made in python with open source code allowing the user to edit and make changes to the game. I encourage people to take the code and adjust it for them selves, this can be with new characters or even modded versions of my game.
